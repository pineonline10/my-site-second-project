# my-site-second-project
##portfolio project
This is a bare-bones skeleton for a future working portfolio 
of my works and ideas.
I built this to satisfy the homework criteria, 
but also - and mainly - because I would like to have material to 
present to possible future employers. 

I learned a lot about affecting HTML code through CSS, the importance
of using the internet (w3schools, stackoverflow, etc.) as a resource for
future projects, and about resizing and hover effects.
